# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - 2026-02-18
Coverage: changes from 2026-02-11 to 2026-02-18.

### Added
- 10-band EQ and related UI controls.
- Bit-perfect playback flow and status indicators.

  - `Pro Bars`

  - `Stars BWR` theme
- Home page improvements (custom mixes, sidebar updates, track time display).
- Added account-scoped local data isolation for history and playlists.

### Changed
- Visualizer naming refined to shorter effect labels:
  - `Wave`, `Fill`, `Mirror`, `Dots`, `Peak`, `Trail`, `Pulse`, `Stereo`, `Burst`, `Fall`, `Spiral`, `Pro Bars`, `Pro Line`, `Pro Fall`
- Improved `Pro Fall` performance by pre-binning spectrum history and reducing per-frame computation.
- Updated visualizer/theme integration so effects follow selected spectrum theme more consistently.
- Reworked `package.sh`:
  - Bundles required source folders (`ui/`, `actions/`, `icons/`).
  - Adds preflight checks.
  - Uses safer shell mode and quoting.
  - Produces dual RPM variants from one command:
    - Fedora (`.fedora`)
    - EL9 (`.el9`)
  - Keeps support for single-variant RPM builds (`rpm-fedora`, `rpm-el9`).
- Updated docs and README structure for releases.
- Multiple fixes in output device restore flow, exclusive mode latency/settings, search behavior, and UI polish.

### Removed
- Removed `IR Waterfall` effect (superseded by `Pro Fall`).
- Removed redundant legacy infrared-only rendering branch.

### Packaging Output (1.0.4)
- `hiresti_1.0.4_all.deb`
- `hiresti-1.0.4-1.fedora.x86_64.rpm`
- `hiresti-1.0.4-1.el9.x86_64.rpm`
